We are a group of soil scientists who want to do better in our work to tackle issues relating to EDI. This project started with a group initiative across students that were all part of the [STARS](www.starsoil.org.uk) studentship programme, and has since grown to include soil scientists from across the world.

To contact us you can either use the links at the bottom of the page, or contact the current project leads [Fiona Seaton](mailto:fseaton@ceh.ac.uk) and [Malika Mezeli](mailto:m.mezeli@lancaster.ac.uk).
