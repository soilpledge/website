To cultivate a diverse and equal community within soil science we need to act together, calling out discriminatory language and behaviour, listening and responding to issues that are raised and enacting EDI and code of conduct policies. Some of these conversations can be difficult, and we need to respect others' effort and not "All lives matter" the conversation. Simple steps that we can do include stopping engaging in all-male, all-white, or in some way homogeneous panels; promoting the voices of underrepresented communities within soil science in our conferences and other events; and including non-English research in meta-analyses.
