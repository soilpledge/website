Science has always been hard to access for non-scientists, leading to great inequalities in who is able to take advantage of scientific advantages - often funded by public money. Recently there has been more efforts towards making scientific publications and data open access for all, which we should contribute to as long it is possible. However, we must consider the rights of the individuals who contributed to this data and respect their wishes as to whether they want their data publicly available. We must also consider not just whether data is equally accessible, but also equitability of access and communicate our work to all stakeholders in a form that is useful for them.
